# IAP Tunnel using Ansible in GCP

IAP allows for secure access to your resources located within your environment. After spinning up a vm instead of using a traditional SSH, IAP verifies user identity and the context of the request to determine if a user should be allowed access to the VM. Ansible allows for us to configure that connection while also standing up the infrastructure needed in a playbook.
